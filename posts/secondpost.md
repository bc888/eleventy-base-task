## Deathrattle Demon Hunter

In the early game, your aim should be to build up a foundation for keeping Deathrattle minions on the board throughout the game. On Turn 1 this largely involves playing and attacking with Tuskpiercer, this can subsequently be followed up by cheap Deathrattle minions like Loot Hoarder and Razorboar.

Throughout this time, the aim is to find key Deathrattle minions in your hand that chain together. Razorboar is the most important minion to look for when assembling these chains as its low Cost means you do not want it to be pulled by another Deathrattle minion, similarly if you have 2 Razorboars it is ideally to try and get them on the board at the same time. In addition to Razorboars, you are also looking to have Razorfen Beastmasters in your hand as it is the ideal target for Razorboar to pull from your hand due to its ability to pull out your higher-Cost Deathrattles. Lastly, you are looking for a 3rd Deathrattle minion to be pulled ideally a 4-Cost Deathrattle like Renowned Performer or a Fel Summoner discounted by Raging Felscreamer. These combos are the backbone of the deck due to the immense difficulty required to remove them from the board.

The deck's Deathrattle plays are more than enough to allow you to comfortably enter the late game, at which point these synergies can be compounded further through the use of the powerful cards like Death Speaker Blackthorn and N'Zoth, God of the Deep. Any remaining follow-up damage can be deal using the combination of Illidari Inquisitor and attacking your opponent directly with your Hero to deal the finishing blow.

Against Aggro, you should look to pull Renowned Performer and Felrattler from you hand to slow down your opponent to help you safely reach the mid game, where the deck hits its stride.

Against Control, you should expect to play a slightly longer game due additional removal being available for your board. To account for this, you should expect to use both copies of Illidari Inquisitor to deal the additional points of burst damage to close out the game.


## Face Hunter

ace Hunter relies on a mix of Rush Minions, Charge minions, and other direct damage sources in order to kill opponents as quickly as possible. While all cards in the deck serve a similar purpose, playing the deck largely comes down to finding the most efficient order to play cards.

In the early game, you want to explode onto the board with your early-game minions like Imprisoned Felmaw, Intrepid Initiate, and Demon Companion. These strong early game options should allow you to take a couple of value trades if your opponent puts up any resistance while being able to push moderate damage to face.

Going into the mid game, your aim is to slow your opponent down while reducing their Health as much as possible. This can be achieved by naturally curving out with minions like Knife Vendor and clearing up the board with Piercing Shot and Trampling Rhino.

The game will largely be won by your opponent's Health going down over the course of the game through consistent face damage. However, you should always be aware of how much burn damage you have in hand. In particular, cards like Quick Shot and Scrap Shot used to deal those final points of damage to close out games.

Against Aggro, you should put a higher priority on controlling the board. If you are able to win the early-game fight for the board, you will often be able to snowball out of control and beat down your opponent, due to the lack of removal and reactive tools found in Aggro decks.

Against Control, managing your resources becomes an important skill. You should try to anticipate how long your resources in hand will last and try to make use of your Hero Power to help prolong your resources if you feel that they are not enough to close out the game.

## Rush Warrior

The aim of this deck is to continually contest the board through the use of Rush minions. Cards like Parade Leader and Playmaker greatly empower any Rush minion that is played, making them a priority to get into play when it is safe to do so.

The minion-heavy nature of the deck allows Rokara to greatly empower minions as they go through their attack cycles, doubling the effect if copied by Playmaker. The constant barrage of Rush minions is enough to pressure most decks into submission, fueled by card draw from cards like Stonemaul Anchorman, Cutting Class, and Outrider's Axe.

Against Aggro, you should make even more effort to make efficient trades onto the board. If you are able to secure control of the board, the game will snowball quickly in your favor due to the lack of removal and board clears present in Aggro decks.

Against Control, games will last slightly longer and you should plan accordingly. Squeezing card draw out of Outrider's Axe, Cutting Class, and Stonemaul Anchorman will go a long way to ensuring you have enough cards to close out the game. Similarly, you should ensure you do not overcommit too heavily to the board so that you do not lose the game entirely to one board clear. A good rule of thumb to follow is to aim for about 12-15 attack spread around approximately 3 minions, or enough cards in hand to refill the board to its current size 1-2 more times.

Masters Tour Dalaran proved to be the Chinese Masters Tour as Wang “ShuiMoo” Qihao defeated Lin “OmegaZero” Zheng, both from China, in a clean 3-0 sweep. ShuiMoo made short work of the final match, with the fourth clean sweep of Day 3, to claim $25,000 in prize money as the Masters Tour Dalaran champion.

Chinese players dominated the third Masters Tour of the year, overall, with three out of the top four positions earned by players from the region. ShuiMoo ultimately pulled ahead in quick and convincing fashion with his Rush Warrior, OTK Demon Hunter, and Miracle Rogue, so much so that there was little reason to doubt that he was the best player at Masters Tour Dalaran. All three decks used by ShuiMoo were piloted by other players as well, but in the end, he came out on top with his quick decision-thinking, with a new championship to show for it.

## What does this mean for ShuiMoo?

The Masters Tour win should be enough to guarantee ShuiMoo a place in next seasons hearthstone Grandmasters, where he can put his skills to the test against the best APAC have to offer! Only time will tell how ShuiMoo will perform on a consistent basis, but we will be here waiting to find out!

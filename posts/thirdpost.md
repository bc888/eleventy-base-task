Like most new patches, this one is going to have a pretty big effect on the competitive scene. Deck balance and the viability of cads really hinge on what changes are made. A change to a few mechanics can ricochet through unconnected cards, removing the competitive edge of a specific deck. Shaman is currently looking like the winner from this release, with most cards synergizing insanely well with Nature spells.

These are the major changes that are coming with the patch:

## Wailing Caverns Mini-Set
The Wailing Caverns mini-set is a part of the Hearthstone patch 20.4 that deserves special mention. This is a brand new mini-set. They launch on June 3rd. They are going to be sets of 35 distinct cards, all taken from Forged in the Barrrens card packs. The entire set comes to 66 cards overall, that’s 4 legendary, 1 epic, 14 rare, and 16 commons. While the new set takes the cake during this patch, there has been some adjustments that mainly impact Paladins and their insane win rate in HS over the past 60 days.

## Paladins take a beatdown
First Day of School – Changed to Add 2 random Card 1-Cost minions to your hand.
Hand of A’dal – Changed to Give a minion +2/+1. Draw a Card.

## New Heroes & Arena Rotation

Muntanus the Devourer – Devour (Costs 0) Remove a friendly minion, split its stats onto another, gain 1 gold.
Guff Runetoten – Natural Balance (Costs 1) Give a friendly minion of each Tavern Tier +2/+1.
Hero Pool – Maiev Shadowsong has been temporarily removed.
New Minion – Hexruin Marauder – Tier 4 Demon. 3 Attack, 5 Health. At the end of your turn, if you have 6 or fewer minons gain +3/+3.
Minion Pool Update – Quilabor is no longer guaranteed, Seigebreaker has been removed from Battlegrounds, and Cap’n Hoggerr’s text has been changed.
Duels Update – The Wailing Caverns mini set will be added into loot buckets and eligible pool of cards on June 3rd.
Arena will include cards from these sets with the new patch:

Wailing Caverns Mini-Set
Forged in the Barrens
Darkmoon Races Mini-set
Madness at the Darkmoon Faire
Scholomance Academy
Ashes of Outland
Kobolds & Catacombs
Goblins vs Gnomes
Core
In addition to these changes, there are going to be a lot of hero skins and card backs returning to the game for you to choose between. Outside of these content updates, there are more books and bug fixes to keep the game running smoothly with the Hearthstone Patch 20.4.

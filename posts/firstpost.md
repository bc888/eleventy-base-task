## Who is this Grandmaster?

During the Hearthstone Grandmasters playoff match Zakarya “xBlyzes” Hail disconnected from the server instead of conceding the game, after having a run of poor draws against his opponent Frenetic.

The community calls this kind of disconnection a “ragequit” due to the combination of anger and frustration that leads to the player leaving the game through less official means than conceding the match. Commentary during the stream said: “My heart goes out to him. It’s a brutal way to lose the series”. Due to the circumstances, Frenetic would need to wait for Admin confirmation that the match was actually conceded.

xBlyzes has had a few issues during the Hearthstone competitive season, including disputes with tournament administrators. He was docked two points for missing a match, and was also accused of win-trading.

xBlyzes also tweeted “I want to die” after his loss. A follower replied by saying “You had and incredible tournament, but what a garbage way to finish it.” To which xBlyzes responded: “sry to be mad because i lost the most important match of my life”.
